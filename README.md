This is employee management project which includes use of rest api, entity relationships, local and cloud database integration using spring profile, exception handling .

After creating different entities we can figure out relationship between them, than using dto we interacts to api end point so dto to entity and entity to dto conversion is must.

for api methods code controller folder gets used: using annotation like : @RestController , @GetMapping, @PostMapping, @PutMapping, @DeleteMapping

also @RequestParam, @RestParam and @PathVariable annotations are used.

used lombok dependency to reduce boilerplate code.

also did testing of apis using swagger.
